# todolist

This is the start of a project to build upon my knowledge of Java. 

The first version is to experiment with classes, as this has a ToDoList class which keeps all of the functionality of the application (reading the list, adding to the list, removing from the list) within one area to improve reusability. 

The next stage is to learn how to firstly connect with a database (likely to be MySQL for now) and then use the current classes to build upon communicating with the database, creating a CRUD application without having to change too much of the Main class. 

After that I will probably be looking into creating an application interface on a web page to provide something more visually stimulating than a console project. This will involve improving my skills with HTML and CSS (probably Bootstrap). How I will interact with the backend isn't known yet, the two options off the top of my head are using Spring Boot or learning a Javascript/Javascript framework to act as the intermediary between the front and back ends.
